            <section>
                <p class="Section">
                     Reflecting on my project, I feel a strong sense of growth in my ability to prioritize user-centered design while creating a meaningful, engaging experience on my hacking-themed site.
                     From the outset, I aimed to foster accessibility and ensure that the web experience could resonate with users of diverse backgrounds and preferences. 
                     To achieve this, I focused on understanding what an authentic hacking interface would feel like to the user and immersed myself in UI research (as detailed in my Theory section). 
                     This inspired the choice of a dark, moody color palette, such as a charcoal black background (#141111) combined with a warm white (#FFFFF0), which visually communicates the "dark side" of the internet, 
                     aligning with the theme of hacking. This atmosphere supports an accessible and aesthetically coherent experience, drawing users into the interactive nature of the site.
                </p>
            </section>
            <h2 class="Sub-heading" id="title1">Acccesibility Prioritization:</h2>
            <section>
                <p class="Section">
                 In terms of accessibility, I was particularly careful to add descriptive captions and alt text to images, ensuring that users reliant on screen readers could fully engage with the content. 
                 This was essential in adhering to my commitment to inclusivity while maintaining the aesthetic of a simulated hacking experience. My “Home” section was designed to introduce users immediately 
                 to this experience by prompting them to enter a nickname. This interaction was intended to feel like the entry point into a hacker's terminal, setting the tone and aligning with user expectations of a hacking environment. 
                 Through thoughtful use of whitespace and a clear visual hierarchy, I guided users’ attention to key focal points, such as the “Get Started” button in the center of the screen, which is critical for creating an intuitive navigation flow from the outset.
                </p>
            </section>


            <h2 class="Sub-heading" id="title2">Intentionality behind the design choices made :</h2>

            <section>
                <p class="Section">
                 I also developed an interactive "Hack" section where users actively engage by clicking on links that mimic phishing scenarios. This was intentional, as I wanted users to experience a scenario that felt realistic and immersive without actual risk. 
                 By making the link appear like a typical internet hyperlink—bolded, colored, and underlined— I replicated cues often seen in phishing attempts, creating an instructional and engaging experience. 
                 The warning message that follows reinforces the lesson, encouraging users to think twice before clicking unfamiliar links, which is key to cultivating an awareness of online security. 
                 This element aligns closely with user-centered design, as it empowers users to learn through direct interaction rather than passive observation.
                </p>
            </section>

            <h2 class="Sub-heading" id="title3">Thoughts behind data visualizations intentionality:</h2>

            <section>
                <p class="Section">
                 Another important addition to the site was interactive data visualizations in which users could manipulate data keys and observe color changes. This functionality invited users to explore the data in ways that best suited their understanding, 
                 fostering a sense of control and enhancing the impact of the visualized content. Through these design decisions, I emphasized the importance of giving users autonomy to derive meaning, highlighting the value of data-driven and user-centered 
                 principles in web design. The  threat map added was an advanced feature aimed at elevating the experience of the phishing cybersecurity issue. The ability to turn on the toggles by clicking on checkbox was particularly satisfying to make 
                 because it allowed users to customise the outcome of the visualization , adding onto the overall experience. The drill down feature that zooms the users into the actual location where the phishing attack occurred was a metaphor for diving 
                 deep into the depth of the darkness of the cyberattack world issue.
                </p>
            </section>

            <h2 class="Sub-heading" id="title4">The balance between code application and design principles:</h2>

            <section>
                <p class="Section">
                 Balancing the technical and design aspects of this project was challenging, and finding harmony between these components became a significant focus post-Assignment 3. I realized that my previous approach had leaned too heavily on coding execution 
                 at the expense of a refined design. Since then, I’ve made intentional changes to my workflow, dedicating time not only to coding but also to reflecting on design choices from a user's perspective. By consistently aiming for clarity and simplicity 
                 in both layout and functionality, I believe I’ve achieved a stronger balance in my final design. Constructive feedback on UI conventions— like using a fixed navigation bar at the top, integrating a scroll-to-top button, adding breathing room between 
                 lines, and using margins and padding to reduce visual clutter—helped me see areas for improvement. Applying ECMAScript 2023 (ES14) standards and embracing async functions for API calls further strengthened my code’s efficiency and consistency.
                </p>
            </section>

            <h2 class="Sub-heading" id="title5">Conclusion</h2>

            <section>
                <p class="Section">
                 This project was a tremendous learning experience, pushing me to integrate user-centered design principles with functional coding skills. While there were challenges, particularly in balancing design and coding, 
                 they ultimately shaped a more thoughtful, well-rounded approach. I am proud of the site’s final form and the efforts I made to improve based on past feedback. This reflection on my journey has highlighted areas 
                 for continued growth, and I am inspired to carry these lessons forward.
