            <section>
                <p class="Section">
                 The widespread adoption of web technologies has significantly impacted global economics and artistic expression. 
                 This essay examines the intersection of user-centric design, accessibility, and data visualization interactivity in my 'Hacking' website, 
                 exploring how these elements foster engaging learning experiences. Through a critical analysis of the site's UI/UX design and content curation,
                 I will reflect on the challenges and successes of the project, assessing its alignment with international web development best practices. 
                 Ultimately, this research aims to demonstrate the potential of web technologies to promote inclusive, interactive, and informative digital experiences, ones that prioritizes design driven by a user-centred approach that caters to diverse needs and preferences.

            <section>
                <p class="Section">
                 Web technologies have had a huge influence on global economies, specifically with regards to how they’ve provided a platform for users around the world to gain insight into the world around them. 
                 Specifically, this has been through allowing   users to access information, connect with others, and express themselves creatively. With over 4.4 billion internet users worldwide <cite>(Morgan, 2019)</cite>, 
                 web technologies have enabled Global connectivity and community building through social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.). 
                 Furthermore, they have also allowed access to educational resources and online courses (e.g., Coursera, edX) as well as provide opportunities for digital entrepreneurship and creative expression (e.g., Etsy, YouTube).
                 Moreover, the growth of the gig economy, with 57 million freelancers in the US alone <cite>(Team , 2023)</cite> demonstrates the extensive impact of the opportunities that web technologies have created 
                 for users to express themselves creatively in the digital space, leveraging the tools available to them like the technologies to increase their global audiences. 
                 By empowering users to showcase their talents and creativity, web technologies have democratized access to artistic expression and facilitated the emergence of new forms of digital art, music, and literature.

            <h3 class="Sub-heading" id="title3">User-Centric Design: Principles and Importance: </h3>
            <section>
                <p class="Section">
                     User-Centric Design (UCD) refers to the thorough understanding of users’ behaviours, needs and preferences by conducting extensive research on the and then applying all that research to 
                     guide the design process of a certain product <cite>(Webflow, 2023)</cite>.
                     UCD takes a holistic approach to design, trying to cater as possible to users’ needs and preferences by also consulting end users during the design process to better understand their 
                     needs and their preferences.  The main principles of UCD include “Data-driven decision making” as well as “Empathy”<cite>(Webflow, 2023)</cite>.Data-driven decision making is about 
                     acknowledging the difference in your users’ expectations and preferences and thus heavily relying on website analytic tools such as “A/B testing” to identify “pain-points” in your users’ preferences that might 
                     be evident in your site and using that information to refine your websites experience<cite>(Webflow, 2023)</cite>. Pain points refer to areas of design that users do not fully get as much as they may have made 
                     sense from the perspective of the designer.
                     Furthermore , Empathy on the other hand has to do with reflecting an in-depth understanding of your audiences’ needs and preferences by incorporating throughout the design process.<cite>(Webflow, 2023)</cite>
                     This principle also considers how the designers design interfaces that are intuitive enough to let the user take charge without hindering their user experience of the overall site. 
                     Not only does the latter principle ground your design within prioritizing user needs, it also ensures that your overall 
                     website fit the needs of your users as far as usability and accessibility are concerned. An example that best reflects a user centred design approach is adherence to accessibility
                     practices such as using highly descriptive “alt” texts for the images used in your site. See figure 1 below:
                     <div class="Chart">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../Images/Accessibility toools.png" title="An accessibility practice of using highly descriptive text for the alt text." width="700" height="400" alt=" An accessibility pratice of a using a descriptive alt text of a woman holding a laptop while pointing to a screen with lines of code">

                </p>
                 <p class="Section">
                     Not only is the latter presentation a testament of including users with diverse accessibility needs, it also ensures that the alt text serves its full purpose for users 
                     who use screen readers do not miss out on any information that others have access to because they are different.

            <h3 class="Sub-heading" id="title4">Demonstration of User Centred Design within my Hacking site to create meaning and successfully engage users:</h3>
            <section>
                <p class="Section">
                 With a particular prioritization of accessibility and fostering an intuitive web experience  for users of different forms of preferences, I tried to adhere to some of the principles I have mentioned above. 
                 For example, to best encapsulate the experience of traversing a hacking themed site, I researched (see Theory section) the various UI design preferences that best render the experience of what a hacking site 
                 would look and feel like. The use of dark colours such as charcoal/smoky black (#141111) as well the use of warm shade of white (#FFFF0) helped in delivering the “dark side” of the internet in a visually appealing way. 
                 All the images used in the site contain a well descriptive fig captions and an alt text to allow screen readers to have the same experience of what other users are seeing. With a particular adherence to the 
                 aesthetic of simulating a hacking experience, I also relied heavily on the use of active engagement to facilitate learning and thus overall understanding. 
                 Thus, in my “Home” section of the site, I prompted users to I put their nickname to welcome them into the site. See figure 2 below. 
                 I intentionally combined this with what I envisioned would create an impression and thus set up the stage for the rest of my site; the feel of being inside a hacking terminal.  
                 Through research done on how users inclined to hacking website would expect the experience of being part of the hacking site would be, I ensured that I prioritize the aesthetic of being in a hacking site 
                 by introducing it quite early in the site.  By using the “hacking terminal as well as the “green” color to align with the aesthetic and the display of the “Get started” button, 
                 I tried ensure that there is a clear visual hierarchy. This was through paying attention to the white space in between the text as well as the focal points in within the homepage 
                 which focus the attention on the centre of the screen.
                 <div class="Chart">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../Images/User Centred Designnn Demo 0.png" title="Visual Hierarchy establishment in the homepage of the site" width="700" height="400" alt="Visual Hierarchy in the homepage section.">

                 </div>
                </p>
                <p class="Section">
                     In the same vein ,  in my “Hack” section of the website, I prompted users to engage making them click a specific link to enhance the overall understanding of what and how the cyber-attack of phishing occurs. 
                     The design choice in the simulation worked well because it mimics real-life phishing scenarios while maintaining a safe, educational environment. By clicking on the link, see Figure 3 below:  users engage actively, 
                     which enhances learning. Instead of passively reading about phishing, they experience a scenario where they need to act and observe the consequences. 
                     Through the latter, I allowed users to experience a sense of Realism in Design and Interaction, using the main principle of designing with the user in mind and “data driven decisions” to create an experience that 
                     is in parallel with what the expectation of traversing a hacking themed site are.
                <div class="Chart">

                </p>
                <p class="Section">
                     By making the link bold, colored, and underlined, it resembles a typical internet link—especially those in unsolicited emails that may be used for phishing. 
                     This design entices clicks, teaching users that anything with such styling could potentially be a lure.
                     Furthermore, as can be seen from Figure 4 below, the warning message reinforces the lesson, encouraging users to think twice before interacting with unfamiliar links in real life. 
                     The emphasis on the danger of phishing fits the theme perfectly, making the simulation both immersive and instructive.
                <div class="Chart">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../Images/User Centred Design Demo 2.png" title="Active engagement and the warning message display as feedback" width="600" height="400" alt="Warning message display from phishing simulation as feedbaack to the user.">

                    </figure>
                </div>
                </p>
                <p class="Section">
                     In essence, the use of the simulation works because it closely mirrors real phishing tactics within a controlled environment, making it an effective learning tool. It uses a blend of subtle deception and educational content to help 
                     users understand and recognize phishing cues without putting them at actual risk. To achieve the latter , I tried to ensure that the experience of being in a hacking themed site aligns with what the expectations of being in a 
                     hacking site would be. I designed with the users in mind , taking into consideration the standard set for both users that are fully immersed into the intricacies of hacking and those that are not. 
                     By paying particular attention to the small details to make the overall experience of traversing the site impactful, I relied on the simple but effective usage of color contrast as well intentional colour choice selection to 
                     deliver the feel and experience at its optimal best for all users, irrespective of the knowledge they may have or not have prior to interacting with the site.
                     Moreover, in my data visualization I tried to foster a sense of interactivity by making the key a variety of buttons that users can click on to notice the colour changes and the overall impact thereof, see Figure 5 below:
                     <div class="Chart">
                        <figure>

                <p class="Section">
                     By giving users the ability to take charge in deriving understanding and meaning from the visualization and the narrative from there, not only does that underscore the alignment with 
                     user centred design principles but it also ensures that users are able to manipulate the information at hand in their own way to get to the same main takeaway from the overall visualization itself.

            <h3 class="Sub-heading" id="title5">  The most pressing challenges faced  during development of this project and how they were tackled</h3>
            <section>
            <p class="Section">
                A key challenge of  executing this project  was not only demonstrating  an understanding of code  but also the ability to showcase an in-depth appreciation  of  design complexity. 
                The most difficult part was striking a good balance between the two major components. Reflecting on my Assignment 3 feedback, I recognised a lot of shortcomings from the design aspect 
                of my project because I was focused a lot on the application of code while overlooking some important design aspects. While the feedback on the code understanding  was well-received, 
                I was disappointed on the shortcomings I had faced in the design aspect of my project. After Assignment 3’s feedback, I’ve made a conscious effort to adjust my approach in trying to find 
                a good balance I mostly struggled with. Each day became an opportunity work  not only on the code  but also a day to also think extensively about the intentionality behind every design aspect 
                of the project and how it is going to look like from the perspective of someone else. For the most part of the design aspect and the changes thereof, I relied heavily on the aspects that 
                Imaan constructively critiqued about the design while also taking appreciation for the ones she commended. This amongst many was sticking to the convention of certain UI interfaces 
                such as the use of scroll to top buttons, having fixed navigation at the top as opposed to having fixed footer, creating line spacing between the lines of my paragraphs, 
                adding padding and margins to ensure that everything  does not feel cluttered.Centering the text and preventing it from spanning across the page also improved  readability. 
                For the most part of my code, I followed Andre’s suggestion to align my work with modern ECMAScript 2023 standard using an async function for fetching of my API data 
                as well as the consistency within the naming of my classes and ids.This included aligning named functions with arrow functions for clarity and consistency. 
                Overall , while the development of this project was a huge learning curve on my end , its mostly the moments that weren’t so great in both components that I struggled to find a good balance of
                 that helped me to improve and aim for a better outcome.

            <h3 class="Sub-heading" id="title6">How the project aligns with professional practices in international web/app development</h3>
            <section>
                <p class="Section">
                     This project may align well with professional practices in international web/app development because it demonstrates a thoughtful integration of User-Centered Design (UCD) principles,
                     accessible design and iterative improvement based on feedback. The following is how :
                     <br>
                      i. User-Centered Design (UCD):
                     <br>
                     The precision in the integration of User-Centered Design (UCD) , prioritizing end-user experience and showing attention to accessibility and inclusivity demonstrates a thoughtful approach 
                     towards designing with empathy and a deep understanding of meeting end-users expectations. For instance, including alt text and fig captions for images supports users with visual impairments,
                     aligning with accessibility standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). The application of the latter instance showcases an understanding of research done to tailor the experience 
                     of the site to meet both the beginner and advanced user expectations of a hacking themed site.
                     <br>
                     ii. Intentional Design Choices and Visual Hierarchy:
                     <br>
                     Professional development  emphasizes visual hierarchy to guide users through content naturally. By prioritizing aspects like color contrast, white space, and hierarchy between my <h> tags,
                     I ensured that users intuitively understand the content flow. By establishing a clear aesthetic from the outset and designing  with intentional color schemes and typography, 
                     I created a cohesive user experience  that mirrors professional practices of UI/UX designs.
                     <br>
                     iii. Attention to Detail and Interaction Design:
                     <br>
                     Designing interactive features like a  clickable phishing simulation and responsive data visualization shows a strong understanding of engagement strategies. 
                     Creating an immersive experience that encourages users to interact with the content reflects the UX design principle of making users feel part of the experience, 
                     enhancing learning and retention.
                     <br>
                     iv. Realism in Design and Functionality:

                     By simulating real world scenarios such as phishing, I applied a valuable UX technique that professional  developers use to help users understand complex topics through familiar , 
                     relatable interactions. This also indicates a strong grasp of designing with purpose, where each element serves an educational or functional purpose.

                 In conclusion , this essay has underscored the transformative potential of web technologies to create immersive , educational and user-centered experiences. 
                 Through reflecting on my hacking site’s application of user-centric design principles such as accessibility, empathy, and data driven insights, 
                 I aimed to build a site that not only reflects the aesthetic and thematic elements of hacking but also prioritizes an inclusive and engaging user experience. 
                 The journey through iterative design improvements and critical feedback integration highlighted the importance of balancing visual appeal,  
                 functionality and accessibility – which are essential aspects of international web development standards. 
                 This project thus serves as a testament to the power of thoughtful design in enhancing user engagement and comprehension, 
                 demonstrating how web technologies can be harnessed to make complex topics such as cyber security accessible and meaningful to a broad audience.(2480)
