        <br>
        <p class="section">1. Hacking Attack : Phishing Scams.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a world wide issue that is inclusive of so many people who have fallen victims of it, I wanted to use a visualization technique that would really get the seriousness 
            of it in a visually compelling way, one that enhances understanding and greater retention value. As such, I decided to use an interactive bar graph chart because through it,
            each individual bar could be used to show different aspects of the subject matter in a way that enhances underdtanding. For example, by using a tooltip
            that shows the number of victims affected or preyed upon by different phishing URL Host names, users get an understanding of the different variations of the subject 
            matter at hand, actively learning about it as they move from one bar to the next. See figure below:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="low">
            <figure>
                <img src="../Images/Demonstration1.png" title="A picture of a bar graph with buttons explained via an annotation on the left" width="700" height="400" aria-label="A bar graph chart with interactive Buttons">

            </figure>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="section">
            With that said, I envisioned the use of each bar to convey a piece of information that is meaningful
            apart from users passively observing or deriving meaning from the size of each bar and that becoming their only point of reference from which  they deduce understanding. 
            The use of each individual bar that each displays a tooltip with  a unique set of information as well an interactive legend , one that users can manipulate to gain an even deeper 
            understanding of the subject matter at hand increased the level of engagement that users have within the site as well the overall experience of traversing the site.
            As such, using a bar graph chart in the context of my thematic content was a specific design and functionality choice because it aided me in deriving the narrative I wanted to
            get across in minimalistic but effective way.

        <p class="section">2. Hacking Attack :  Ransomware Attacks.
           <br>
           <br>
           For this aspect of hacking , I wanted to focus more on making users underdtand the second part of aspect of the cybersecurity at hand, extensively focusing 
           on the repercussions of it. As a dark aspect of the internet that most users are not deeply immersed into because of the stigma attached to it, beginning to 
           uncover the real egents that steer the ship of victimizing users online was one of the key things i wanted to get across. That way, if users are aware of who 
           these agents are and what methods they use to prey upon them , they can alter their own online activity to be more mindful of even the most "smallest" things like the 
           domain names or protocol of the sites they interact  with , something that most people do not necessarily pay attention to, hence its easier to prey on ignorant
           online users. By using a pie chart with buttons functionality, I wanted users to derive meaning in a different way as opposed to the standard setup and layout of 
           pie charts. Allowing users click a button that corresponds with a specific ransomwaregroup on the chart and thus change or manipulate the state of the chart itself
           allowed for an extra room to derive understanding apart from using the size of the charts and percentages to infer understanding. See figure below:
           <br>
           <br>
           <div class="low">
           <figure>
            <img src="../Images/Demonstration P2.png" title="A picture of a 2D Pie Chart with interactive buttons at the bottom of the chart" width="1000" height="500" aria-label="A 2D Pie chart with interactive Buttons">

            <br>
            <p class="section">
           Each button click and thus an "expose" (pronounced expo(zay))
           of each ransomware group, also symbolized by the protruding of a slice of the pie was meant to highlight or reinforce the idea of what it means to bring to "light" what
           remains in the "dark" side of the internet (pun intended). By protruding each slice of the pie each time a corresponding ransomwaregroup button is clicked, I aimed to make users understand
           what making something "stand out" can mean in the context of the subject matter at hand.That is , the transition of each slice "popping out" is a direct reflection 
           of exposing or uncovering the "masks" behind the attacks of different victims of the world. That way users become aware of this knowledge that was delivered in a way that fosters 
           engagement and interactivity apart from the pie sizes and the percentages on them. The use of the tooltip for each pie slice was meant to add up to what is already there in 
           increasing understanding and greater retention value.

                <p class="section">
                 The following is one of the sites I used for inspiration for this site. It is called "Hack This Site"
                 It is an online hacking and security website , centred around allowing people who already have the skill of hacking to  ethically hone it
                 through various legal training and practices.
                 <br>

                 <br>
                 <br>
                 What was particularly  interesting in this site  was the stylistic choice to use black/dark background color to accentuate the blue and white text color.
                 The black background played a huge role in implying the aesthetic of a "dark" world, similar to how I've used the balck background to infer the same idea.
                 Creating accessible designs is important and I tried to ensure that I am precise with each design decision and the implication that has on other users that may not be the same as everyone.
                 This is where I got the inspo to also maintain the same level of accesibility , one that prioritises readability and smooth traversal of site as shown 
                 in the figure below:

                This is another site that I used for inspiration. It is called "Hack The Box"

                 What was particularly interesting about this site that informed my decision to use the green text color in the way that I have explained in my style guide , apart from the
                 good contrast and aesthetically  visual harmony between the black bakcground and green text color, is how they use the color to communicate the set of <strong>correct actions</strong> 
                 that users are allowed to do as well as emphasize specific parts of the site that are important and thus users should pay more attention to. See figure(s) below :
