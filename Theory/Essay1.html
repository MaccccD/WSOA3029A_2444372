                <p class="Section">
                 Data visualizations have revolutionized the way we understand complex information, but can it also be used to expose algorithmic biases and existing power structures in AI models? 
                 This essay critically examines the data visualization techniques used in the 'Lighthouse Reports' case study on 'Suspicious machine methodology', focusing on the Rotterdam algorithmic risk scoring system. 
                 Through a close analysis of the UI/UX principles, data-driven storytelling, and interactivity, this essay reveals how this case study has utilized data visualizations techniques in ways that enabled users 
                 to decipher the algorithm's decision-making process. By combining the use of narrative elements used in the case study and the interactive elements used, it will also reveal how the latter combination has 
                 contributed to the successful scrutiny of the model within which the risk scoring system was built and the implications of the way the data was presented has on the insights that users derived from the project.

                 “Suspicious machine methodology” by Justin-Casimir Braun et al, published on the Wired website on the 06th of March 2023 at 07h00 is data-driven journalism methodology that aimed to expose the discrepancies of 
                 the machine learning algorithm of a risk scoring system by analysing the algorithm’s inputs and outputs. To do this, the journalism piece utilized data-driven journalism techniques, including data analysis and 
                 visualizations, to examine the algorithm's decision-making process. In doing this, it also revealed the ways in which the algorithm has been discriminatory against certain ethnic groups based on gender, age and 
                 the ability to speak a Dutch language. This methodology examines a machine learning model deployed by Rotterdam, a city in Netherlands. As a welfare provider to the residents of the city, Rotterdam has used a 
                 risk -scoring system to identify potential fraud and optimize welfare distribution, but ultimately perpetuating biases <cite>(Braun, 2023)</cite>. This fraud prediction system processes different inputs including age, gender, 
                 language skills etc. to generate a risk score between 0 and 1, impacting thousands of individuals relying on welfare support, exacerbating social inequalities. The project's key finding is that the algorithm 
                 perpetuates biases against certain ethnic groups, highlighting the need for transparency and accountability in machine learning systems <cite>(Braun, 2023; Kollias, 2023)</cite>.

            <h3 class="Sub-heading">Data Visualization Techniques Used :</h3>
            <section>
               <p class="Section">
                 The "Suspicious machine methodology" employs a range of data visualization techniques to present statistical information in an accessible and intuitive manner. Bar charts are used to illustrate the factors contributing
                 to the flagging of Rotterdam's welfare recipients, with longer bars indicating greater impact. Tree diagrams provide a detailed breakdown of the scoring process, tracing the trajectory of questions and answers that lead 
                 to a risk score between 0 and 1. Scatter plots, displayed in a histogram format, use color-coded circles to represent individual risk scores, facilitating a clear distinction between high and low-risk categories. 
                 The judicious selection and application of these techniques enable users to decipher the data's underlying objectives. For instance, the use of color-coded circles in scatter plots accelerates understanding of risk score differences, 
                 while the histogram format contextualizes the data, revealing the factors determining flagging decisions.
