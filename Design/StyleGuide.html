                    1. To embody the site's core 'dark' theme, I chose a black background (#000000) to evoke a sense of mystery and sophistication. This aesthetic creates an immersive, intense atmosphere
                    & aligns with the site's purpose which is to shed light on the cyber-security issue of hacking , educating users about its impacts and the different types of hacking there are.
                    It draws inspiration from other hacking sites such as “HackThisSite” and “TryHackMe”.
                    The dark background sets the tone for a dramatic, engaging user experience .

                Main Text colors : 
                2. For the main text color, I chose #FFFFFF (white) to create a high-contrast visual design. 
                This combination with the black background (#000000) enhances readability, reduces eye strain, and ensures accessibility for all users, including those with visual disabilities such as:
                - Color blindness
                - Cataracts
                - Myopia
                This design choice aligns with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) and promotes a clean, minimalist aesthetic.
                </p>
                <p class="section">
                3. The color green => HEX CODE: #317B22 => Navigation and Footer section color. 
                I chose green to symbolize successful actions and confirm correct navigation throughout the site. 
                This color serves as a visual affirmation, reassuring users they're on the right path. 
                The high contrast between the black backdrop and green text enhances readability, ensuring seamless navigation. 
                Additionally, this color scheme promotes visual harmony, creating a positive user experience.
                </p>
                <p class="section">
                4. The color Red => HEX Code : #FF0000 => I chose red to symbolize the  danger that comes with the phishing scams and ransomware attacks  aspect of hacking. 
                The good contrast between the black background with a red text color foreground informs the mysterious nature of the hacking theme, 
                aiding deeper understanding of the aspects of hacking focused on as well as the data visualization techniques used to demonstrate the danger . 
                While Red works well to signify the latter, it also affects readability for users who may have visual disabilities . 
                As such I decided to also use the “bittersweet” red color with hex code “#FF5D5D”. 
                This color is close enough to the main red and most importantly is accessible as far as readability is concerned  to people with various forms visual disabilities.

                5. Main Font => Helvetica: 
               
                For optimal readability and accessibility, I selected Helvetica as the primary font. Its clean design and neutral aesthetic ensure a seamless user experience. 
                Helvetica's legibility benefits users with visual impairments, aligning with WCAG 2.1 guidelines..
                1. Readability: Helvetica's clean, sans-serif design ensures clear text rendering, making it easy for users to read and understand content.
                2. Accessibility: Helvetica's legibility benefits users with visual impairments, such as:
                        - Low vision: Clear letterforms and generous x-height facilitate reading.
                        - Color blindness: Neutral color palette compatibility.
                        - Dyslexia: Simple, consistent font shape helps with text tracking.
                3. Neutrality: Helvetica's neutral aesthetic avoids visual distractions, focusing users on content.
                4. Versatility: Suitable for various font sizes, styles, and formatting.

               6. Site Logo Img:
                For now, I have put a placeholder image that stands to represent the logo of the site. 
                I’m am yet to design  a new logo and  it will show up in the top left hand corner of the screen. 
                The reason I went with that specific position is because considering that most people read from left to right unless you’re Japanese, 
                the logo image placed within that position will help infer the idea of what this overall site is about or at least give someone an idea of what it could be about.

                7. External Social Media Icons:
              
               -I have decided to use these icons as social media icons for the site. I will put these in the footer section , just above the copyrights reserved text. 
               The reason I have decided to place these external icons there is because it will allow user to easily reach me after scrolling through the content of the site. 
               They wouldn’t have to scroll up to get taken to the “email” section because it would be right at the end , where they will also end up after having gone through the different sections of the site. 
               Another reason the icons are also placed there is because they aren’t as much of a priority as far as the purposes of this site is concerned, 
               they are just a way for users to also either contact me or get exposed to my other sites such my Be-hance  or my personal Github page.

               8. Navigation Icons:
              
               I have decided to go with these Icons above for the “Previous”, “Next” and “Up” navigation buttons. 
               The reason I chose these specific icons is because of how the silhouette background contrast really well with the white colored icons or arrows. 
               Not only will these be clearly visible to users of different visual abilities but it also effectively conveys what the icon or button means without any need of 
               text-descriptions to be added for the user.

                    9. Nav Bar Design Decisions :
                    
                    For my Nav Bar, I chose to go with consistent design choice of allowing users to hover over the item they want to navigate to and have that menu item hovered over turn into uppercase.
                    The reason for this design decision was to create a feedback loop that lets users know they have done something. It provides an immediate visual response.
                    The text color changing to green to symbolize the current page the user is on was also a deliberate design choice made to reinforce the idea of what the green text color stands to mean ,
                    which is to also inform users that they are doing the right action or traversing the site. The Logo is positioned to the left of the bar wile the actual menu or Navigation are to the right side of the screen
                    because considering that people read from left to right, their eyes will eventually end up on the right side of the screen, a perfect end point for a call to action , where they can click
                    a specific menu or navigation item and get redirected somewhere else. Thus the position was considered from an intuitive standpoint , justfified in terms of how it interplays well with usability conventions and user expectations.
                    in the correct way. Through these design decisions , :
                    1. Visual cues are improved because they help users with visual impairments.
                    2. Color contrast is achieved  as sufficient contrast between text and background enhances visual harmony and thus deepr engagement onto the content of the site.
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="section">
                    10. Button Choices and explanation :
                    
                    -With a particular prioritization on user friendliness and inviting design cues, I decided to make use of rounded shaped buttons, especially around the corner of the edges of the button.
                    This is because a rounded or circular button shape is more inviting for the user to want to intuitively click on it as opposed to the use of a very straight,  square corner edges. Shapes
                    play an importamt role in inferring meaning and by virtue of that , the visual appeals of the button within my site are going to be created with the 
                    consideration of how they will get users to intuitively use their thoughts to interact with this site. That is, be able to infer that the rounded shape button is encouraging the user 
                    to "click" on it to go to the next thing. The rounded shaped edges convey a strong sense of friendliness and "playfullness" as opposed to a button that has square shaped , creating a very 
                    professional outlook, which is far from the type of content to be found within my site.

                12. Loading Screen Hourglass Icon :
              
               This is an Hour glass Loading screen indicator.  
               The reason I have it is because sometimes the  DOM HTML content usually takes too long to parse before the JavaScript loads fully. 
               Therefore,  while users wait, this icon is meant to rotate in a 360 degree anti-clockwise direction to signify to users that the screen is loading.
