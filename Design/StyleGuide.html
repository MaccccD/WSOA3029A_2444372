                    <p class="Section">Main Background color: 
                    1. To embody the site's core 'dark' theme, I chose a charcoal/smoky black background (#141111) to evoke a sense of mystery and sophistication. This aesthetic creates an immersive, intense atmosphere
                    & aligns with the site's purpose which is to shed light on the cyber-security issue of hacking , educating users about its impacts and the different types of hacking there are.
                    It draws inspiration from other hacking sites such as “HackThisSite” and “TryHackMe”.
                    The dark background sets the tone for a dramatic, engaging user experience .

                Main Text colors : 
                2. For the main text color, I chose #FFFF0 (ivory) to create a warm contrast between the charcoal /smoky black and this shade of white.. 
                This combination with the charcoal/smoky black background (#141111) enhances readability, reduces eye strain, and ensures accessibility for all users, including those with visual disabilities such as:
                - Color blindness
                - Cataracts
                - Myopia
                This design choice aligns with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) and promotes a clean, minimalist aesthetic.

                <p class="Section">
                3. The color green => HEX CODE: #317B22 => Navigation and Footer section color. 
                I chose green to symbolize successful actions and confirm correct navigation throughout the site. 
                This color serves as a visual affirmation, reassuring users they're on the right path. 
                The high contrast between the black backdrop and green text enhances readability, ensuring seamless navigation. 
                Additionally, this color scheme promotes visual harmony, creating a positive user experience.
                </p>
                <p class="Section">
                4. The color Red => HEX Code : #FF2626 => I chose red to symbolize the  danger that comes with the phishing scams and ransomware attacks  aspect of hacking. 
                The good contrast between the black background with a red text color foreground informs the mysterious nature of the hacking theme, 
                aiding deeper understanding of the aspects of hacking focused on as well as the data visualization techniques used to demonstrate the danger . 
                While Red works well to signify the latter, it also affects readability for users who may have visual disabilities . 
                As such I decided to also use the “bittersweet” red color with hex code “#FF5D5D”. 
                This color is close enough to the main red and most importantly is accessible as far as readability is concerned  to people with various forms visual disabilities.

            <p class="Section">  Accessibility Priorities: 
                As someone that recognizes the importance of including EVERYONE and ensuring that every person has access to my site and have been considered in the process
                of designing this site, I tried to ensure that I keep the overall site as accessible as possible to users of different vision spectrums.
                As such the following are some of the screengrabs of my site ran through different vision spectrums to check how visible the text and  how the colors look from someone who falls
                under one of the categories of the different vision spectrums/disabilities:
                </p>

             </figure>
             <p class="Section">
               While a user with complete color blindness cannot see any colors of the site, the mention of the actual color(s) in the key  and the clear text color helps
               gives the users an idea of what this may look like even though they cannot visually see it.
             </p>
             <p class="Section">
                Considering that one of the main prominent colors of the site is green , I also tried running the site from the vision spectrum of someone whose eyes cannot detect greens and this
                is what this may look like to them:
             </p>
             <figure>

             </figure>
             <p class="Section">
                As can be seen , the inability to see green colors doesn't distort the overall accessibility of what is written. The color may be different but it still looks easy on the eye.

             <p class="Section">
                While the user may have a cloudy vision, their accessibility to what the text reads as and what the colors may looks like is till very much visible to them. It may be slightly 
                distorted but it still doesn't "cloud" their accsibility. (pun intened)
             </p>
             <p class="Section">
                Considering that one of the main prominent colors of the buttons in this site is blue , I also tried running the site from the vision spectrum of someone whose eyes cannot detect blues & yellows and this
                is what this may look like to them:

             </figure>
             <p class="Section">
               While a user with Tritanopia cannot clearly see the shade of blue used in the site, the shade of blue that they can see is still very much accssible to them and isn't far fetched from the
               original blue used, enhancing the overall visibility of the button color used & the consideration thereof for people who have Tritanopia.

                5. Main Font => Helvetica: 
               
                For optimal readability and accessibility, I selected Helvetica as the primary font. Its clean design and neutral aesthetic ensure a seamless user experience. 
                Helvetica's legibility benefits users with visual impairments, aligning with WCAG 2.1 guidelines..
                1. Readability: Helvetica's clean, sans-serif design ensures clear text rendering, making it easy for users to read and understand content.
                2. Accessibility: Helvetica's legibility benefits users with visual impairments, such as:
                        - Low vision: Clear letterforms and generous x-height facilitate reading.
                        - Color blindness: Neutral color palette compatibility.
                        - Dyslexia: Simple, consistent font shape helps with text tracking.
                3. Neutrality: Helvetica's neutral aesthetic avoids visual distractions, focusing users on content.
                4. Versatility: Suitable for various font sizes, styles, and formatting.

                I’m am yet to design  a new logo and  it will show up in the top left hand corner of the screen. 
                The reason I went with that specific position is because considering that most people read from left to right unless you’re Japanese, 
                the logo image placed within that position will help infer the idea of what this overall site is about or at least give someone an idea of what it could be about.

               -I have decided to use these icons as social media icons for the site. I will put these in the footer section , just above the copyrights reserved text. 
               The reason I have decided to place these external icons there is because it will allow user to easily reach me after scrolling through the content of the site. 
               They wouldn’t have to scroll up to get taken to the “email” section because it would be right at the end , where they will also end up after having gone through the different sections of the site. 
               Another reason the icons are also placed there is because they aren’t as much of a priority as far as the purposes of this site is concerned, 
               they are just a way for users to also either contact me or get exposed to my other sites such my Be-hance  or my personal Github page.

                   -For  the Button design , I decided to go with minimalistic yet bold design. By choosing the blue (#2503FD) complemented with the ivory (#FFFF0) text color , not only does the 
                   visual color  contrast between the two enhance the bold look, it also helped highlight the text written within the button. The rounded edges of the 
                   button add warmth and intuitiveness to invite users to want to click on it. The absence of decoration on the button is particularly a delibarate choice because
                   it grabs the user's attention, aligning with modern design trends that emphasize clarity and purpose.
                   More over, by choosing the  green (#035603) and smoky black (#141111) for the Scroll to Top Btn, I prioritized color scheme adherence to the rest of the site's theme.
                   The color contrast between the latter colors creates a "techy" feel complemented by the rounded edges. I positined it at the bottom right corner because
                   its placement position is intuitive enough to let users know that it helps them scroll back up, as users expect utility functions like “Scroll to Top” to be in this location.
                   The design of the arrows facing up as a visual cue  further makes intention of the button clear, reducing cognitive load and ensuring that users understand its function instantly.

                    9. Nav Bar Design Decisions :
                    
                    For my Nav Bar, I chose to go with consistent design choice of allowing users to hover over the item they want to navigate to and have that menu item hovered over turn into uppercase.
                    The reason for this design decision was to create a feedback loop that lets users know they have done something. It provides an immediate visual response.
                    The text color changing to green to symbolize the current page the user is on was also a deliberate design choice made to reinforce the idea of what the green text color stands to mean ,
                    which is to also inform users that they are doing the right action or traversing the site. The Logo is positioned to the left of the bar wile the actual menu or Navigation are to the right side of the screen
                    because considering that people read from left to right, their eyes will eventually end up on the right side of the screen, a perfect end point for a call to action , where they can click
                    a specific menu or navigation item and get redirected somewhere else. Thus the position was considered from an intuitive standpoint , justfified in terms of how it interplays well with usability conventions and user expectations.
                    in the correct way. Through these design decisions , :
                    1. Visual cues are improved because they help users with visual impairments.
                    2. Color contrast is achieved  as sufficient contrast between text and background enhances visual harmony and thus deepr engagement onto the content of the site.

                    10. Button Choices and explanation :
                    
                    -With a particular prioritization on user friendliness and inviting design cues, I decided to make use of rounded shaped buttons, especially around the corner of the edges of the button.
                    This is because a rounded or circular button shape is more inviting for the user to want to intuitively click on it as opposed to the use of a very straight,  square corner edges. Shapes
                    play an importamt role in inferring meaning and by virtue of that , the visual appeals of the button within my site are going to be created with the 
                    consideration of how they will get users to intuitively use their thoughts to interact with this site. That is, be able to infer that the rounded shape button is encouraging the user 
                    to "click" on it to go to the next thing. The rounded shaped edges convey a strong sense of friendliness and "playfullness" as opposed to a button that has square shaped , creating a very 
                    professional outlook, which is far from the type of content to be found within my site.

                12. Loading Screen Hourglass Icon :
              
               This is an Hour glass Loading screen indicator.  
               The reason I have it is because sometimes the  DOM HTML content usually takes too long to parse before the JavaScript loads fully. 
               Therefore,  while users wait, this icon is meant to rotate in a 360 degree anti-clockwise direction to signify to users that the screen is loading.
